## Ideas

###1) Remake of 2048

2048 is a game involving blocks with numeric values of 2 to the nth power (1,2,4,8, etc). The game is won when a block of 2048 is created. The game is lost when no further moves can be made for lack of space.

###2) Remake of Flappy Bird

Flappy Bird involves a background moving to the left along the x axis while a centered flying character alters its y value in order to hop or fly over the moving background objects.

###3) Remake of Tetris
